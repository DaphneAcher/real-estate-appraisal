        "content": "A clean and well-maintained home creates a strong first impression. Declutter rooms, mow the lawn, and fix minor issues like leaky faucets or chipped paint. Make sure all areas are accessible for the appraiser, including the attic, garage, and any crawlspaces. Provide documentation for upgrades you've made such as permits or receipts. Finally, understand local comps so you're aware of the market value."

        "content": "The FEMA 50% Rule limits how much you can spend on repairs if your structure is below Base Flood Elevation and in a flood zone. The rule states you cannot spend more than 50% of the structure's appraised value unless the entire property is brought into compliance. We provide FEMA-compliant appraisals that help cities determine whether you're under or over the 50% threshold."
